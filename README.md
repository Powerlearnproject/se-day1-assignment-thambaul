# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is basically developing, desinging, testing and maintaining software systems.
it's importance
scalability
innovation and growth


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the intoduction of SP
The advent of OOP
The agile methodology movement.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
REqirement analysid
system design
implemantation
testing
deployment
maintance


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
the waterfall methodology follows a linnear and sequential approach while agile follows an iterative approach.
the waterfall methodology detailed planning and documention are done upfront while in agile methodology allows for continuous revisions and improvements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software engineer
Roles
responsible for designing, coding, testing and maintaing software applications.
they translate project requirements into functional software products.
responsibilites
coding
software design
testing
debugging

Quality Assurance Engineer
Role
they focus on identifyinh defects and issues in the sofware throught systematic testing

responsibilities
test planning
manual and automated testing
defect tracking 
regression testing
test automation

Project manager
role
responsible for planning, executing and closing projects.

responsibilities
project planning 
resource management
risk management
team cooordination.




Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs
enhanced productivity
error detection and reduction
efficient management development
automation and integration

VCS
source code management
collaborration and teamwork
accountability and transparency
risk mitigation


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
managing complexity
dealing with changing requirements
balancing quality and deadlines
technical debt


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit
involves testing individual components or functions of a software application.it is performode during development process.
importance
to verify that each unit of the code perfomes as expected

integration
focuses on veryfying that different modules of the application work together correctly.
importance.
to ensure that combined modules ineteract without issues

system
involves testing the complete inegrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements
importance
to validate end to end functionality

acceptance
performed to determine wheher the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery.
importance
testing a point of sale system to ensure it meets all the functional requirements before it is deployed in a store. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models

prompt engineering involves designing and refining input prommts to give desired outputs from languige models.
importance
enhances model accuracy
optimizes performancies


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
